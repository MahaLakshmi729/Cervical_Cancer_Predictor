## Introduction

Cervical cancer is a significant public health concern worldwide, affecting women of all ages and backgrounds. It is the fourth most common cancer in women, and in many regions, it remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among females. The disease is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix.
